# mern-gql

we have used apollo-server-express package to run both apollo and express server at the same time

#merge-graphql-schemas is depricated, so now we use graphql-tools instead.
#this will help create multiple files of typeDefs and resolvers and merge those and much more

all the packages are upto date at the time of creating the project
